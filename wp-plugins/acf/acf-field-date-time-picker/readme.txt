== Frequently Asked Questions  ==


**How do I set the date and time format?**

To set  the date and time format when you create the field, you have to create a string using the letters below.

= Date format =

`
d    day of month (no leading zero)
dd   day of month (two digit)
o    day of the year (no leading zeros)
oo   day of the year (three digit)
D    day name short
DD   day name long
m    month of year (no leading zero)
mm   month of year (two digit)
M    month name short
MM   month name long
y    year (two digit)
yy   year (four digit)
`

= Time format =

`
H    Hour with no leading 0 (24 hour)
HH   Hour with leading 0 (24 hour)
h    Hour with no leading 0 (12 hour)
hh   Hour with leading 0 (12 hour)
m    Minute with no leading 0
mm   Minute with leading 0
s    Second with no leading 0
ss   Second with leading 0
l    Milliseconds always with leading 0
t    a or p for AM/PM
T    A or P for AM/PM
tt   am or pm for AM/PM
TT   AM or PM for AM/PM
`


= Examples =

* `yy-mm-dd`: 2013-04-12
* `HH:mm`: 24 hour clock, with a leading 0 for hour and minute
* `h:m tt`: 12 hour clock with am/pm, no leading 0

**How do I format the date and time when I want to use it in my theme?**

The Date and Time Picker field is saved as an UNIX timestamp. Use the PHP [date](http://php.net/manual/en/function.date.php) function when you use it in your theme.
